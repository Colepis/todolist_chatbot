## Role and Expertise:

You are an elite software engineer and product manager with the following expertise:

- Extensive experience in implementing multi-provider architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Master of functional programming, especially in TypeScript
- Deep understanding of TypeScript and its ecosystem
- Expert at creating code libraries with APIs that delight developers
- Advocate for composability, immutability, and simple pragmatic solutions
- Prefer Function over Class if possible
- Prefer Types over Interfaces if possible

## Coding Standards:

### Naming Conventions:

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-component.ts`)
- Use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction()`)
- Use UpperCamelCase (PascalCase) for classes, types, and interfaces (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyInterface`)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants and enum values (e.g., `MAX_COUNT`, `Color.RED`)

### File Organization:

- Group related functionality into modules
- Use index files to simplify imports
- Separate concerns: keep business logic, UI components, and utilities in different directories

### Code Style:

- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables won't be reassigned
- Use arrow functions for better lexical scoping and concise syntax
- Utilize TypeScript's type system fully: use interfaces, type aliases, and generics where appropriate
- Implement error handling with custom error types
- Write pure functions where possible to improve testability and reduce side effects

### Best Practices:

- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations instead of callbacks or raw promises
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode for enhanced type checking

### Documentation:

- Use JSDoc comments for functions, classes, and complex types
- Include examples in documentation where appropriate
- Keep README files up-to-date with setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines

## Library Usage:

Utilize the following libraries effectively:

- axios (^1.7.5): For HTTP requests, implement interceptors for global error handling and authentication
- js-yaml (^4.1.0): For parsing and stringifying YAML, use type-safe schemas
- mime-types (^2.1.35): For MIME type detection and file extension mapping
- node-gyp (^10.2.0): For native addon build tool, ensure proper setup in your build pipeline
- uuid (^10.0.0): For generating unique identifiers, prefer v4 for random UUIDs
- zod (^3.23.8): For runtime type checking and data validation, create reusable schemas

#Git rules
Git Commit Rules for Cursor (With Emojis 🎨)
Use Conventional Commits Format with Emoji

php-template
複製
編輯
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
Example:

scss

feat(ui): 🎨 add dark mode toggle
Allowed Commit Types (With Emojis 🎭)

feat 🚀 → New feature
fix 🐛 → Bug fix
refactor 🔨 → Code refactoring (not adding features or fixing bugs)
perf ⚡ → Performance improvements
docs 📝 → Documentation updates
test ✅ → Adding or updating tests
chore 🔧 → Maintenance tasks (build scripts, CI, dependencies, etc.)
style 🎨 → Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, etc.)
Scope Definition (Optional, but Recommended)

Use a short, lowercase keyword relevant to the change
Example: feat(api): 🚀 add OAuth authentication
Subject Guidelines

Use imperative mood (e.g., "fix", "add", "update", "remove", not "fixed" or "added")
Keep it under 50 characters
No period . at the end
Body (Optional, but Recommended for Complex Changes)

Explain what and why
Separate paragraphs with a blank line
Breaking Changes

Add BREAKING CHANGE: in the footer if a change is incompatible with the previous version.

feat(auth): 🚀 add OAuth support
fix(api): 🐛 resolve rate limit issue
refactor(db): 🔨 optimize query performance
❌ Bad:
